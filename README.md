# The Project

After 9 weeks of hard work, we developed an absolutely amazing full-stack application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance where anyone can open their phone or computer and start playing immediately with others! Although not everyone on the team was experienced in web development, everyone was delegated a task that was challenging yet achievable, ensuring everyone contributed to the project.
